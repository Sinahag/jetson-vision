# Jetson Nano Development Kit
## Machine Vision Object Detection for FrisMe
This is the software that will support the machine vision for the FrisMe Frisbee Throwing Device. It will be running an object detection software to actively detect targets and communicate with the core system to launch to that destination.
The components used in this project include:
- Jetson Nano Development Kit (https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
- 2x CSI Wide Angle IMX219 Camera Sensors (https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/seeed-technology-co-ltd/114992263/12396924)

The device will communicate with a BeagleBone using GPIO.
